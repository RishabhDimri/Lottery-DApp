Welcome to the Lottery DApp! Our DApp is a decentralized lottery system that allows you to participate in a fun and exciting lottery game using Ethereum. Here's how it works: The lottery is managed by a designated manager. Players can enter the lottery by paying a small entry fee of 0.001 ETH. Once the entry period is over, the manager will randomly select a winner from the pool of participants. The lucky winner will be able to claim the prize by clicking on the "Claim Reward" button. It's a fair and transparent way to test your luck and potentially win big!
